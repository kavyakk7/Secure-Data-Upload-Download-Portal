A computer network, often simply referred to as a network, is a collection of computers and other hardware components interconnected by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information.[1] Where at least one process in one device is able to send/receive data 
to/from at least one process residing in a remote device, then the two devices are said to 
be in a network. Simply, more than one computer interconnected through a communication 
medium for information interchange is called a computer network.

Networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics, such as the 
medium used to transport the data, communications protocol used, scale, topology, and 
organizational scope.

Communications protocols define the rules and data formats for exchanging information 
in a computer network, and provide the basis for network programming. Well-known 
communications protocols include Ethernet, a hardware and link layer standard that is 
ubiquitous in local area networks, and the Internet protocol suite, which defines a set
 of protocols for internetworking, i.e. for data communication between multiple networks,
 as well as host-to-host data transfer, and application-specific data transmission formats.


Computer networking is sometimes considered a sub-discipline of electrical engineering,
 telecommunications, computer science, information technology or computer engineering, 
since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines.
