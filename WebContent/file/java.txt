What Is Java?

Java is a computer programming language. It enables programmers to write computer 
instructions using English based commands, instead of having to write in numeric codes.
It’s known as a “high-level” language because it can be read and written easily by humans.
Like English, Java has a set of rules that determine how the instructions are written.
These rules are known as its “syntax”. Once a program has been written, the high-level
instructions are translated into numeric codes that computers can understand and execute.

Who Created Java?

In the early nineties, Java was created by a team led by James Gosling for 
Sun Microsystems. It was originally designed for use on digital mobile devices, 
such as cell phones. However, when Java 1.0 was released to the public in 1996,
its main focus had shifted to use on the Internet. It provided more interactivity 
with users by giving developers a way to produce animated webpages . Over the years
it has evolved as a successful language for use both on and off the Internet. A decade 
later, it’s still an extremely popular language with over 6.5million developers worldwide.
