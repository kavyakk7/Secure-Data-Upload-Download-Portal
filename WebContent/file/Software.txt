Computer software, or just software, is a collection of computer programs and related 
data that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it. 
Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the 
computer for some reasons. In other words, software is a set of programs, procedures, 
algorithms and its documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system.
 Program software performs the function of the program it implements, either by directly 
providing instructions to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of 
software. The term was coined to contrast to the old term hardware (meaning physical 
devices). In contrast to hardware, software "cannot be touched". Software is also 
sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning application software only. Sometimes the 
term includes data that has not traditionally been associated with computers, such as film,
 tapes, and records.

Computer software is so called to distinguish it from computer hardware, which encompasses
 the physical interconnections and devices required to store and execute (or run) the 
software. At the lowest level, executable code consists of machine language instructions
 specific to an individual processor. A machine language consists of groups of binary 
values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its
 preceding state. Programs are an ordered sequence of instructions for changing the state 
of the computer in a particular sequence. It is usually written in high-level programming 
languages that are easier and more efficient for humans to use (closer to natural language)
 than machine language. High-level languages are compiled or interpreted into machine 
language object code. Software may also be written in an assembly language, essentially,
 a mnemonic representation of a machine language using a natural language alphabet. 
Assembly language must be assembled into object code via an assembler.
